## Description

Titanic life prediction is popular prediction problem set from kaggle. It is a getting started competition completely designed for beginners. The objective is very simple, we use the data to predict either someone will survive or not from Titanic disaster event. Titanic itself is a luxury ship that sank after colliding with an iceberg.

**Purpose**

The purpose of this model is to predict if a passenger will be survive or not based on attributes attached on them.

**Algorithm**

The algorithm used will be classification model type such as logistic regression, decission tree, GBM, and other type of machine learning algorithm for classification.

**Evaluation**

In other to evaluate the model, I will use some metrics such as AUC ROC curve, Sensitivity, Specificity and F1 score.
