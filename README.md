Karkinos is a part of DAAC (Data as a Content) project. This project stores all raw files (image, code, etc) for each project I created.

## DATA ANALYSIS FLOW STANDARD

Data analysis in this part is limited to descriptive, diagnostic or prescriptive analysis.

-   **Problem Statement**. Problem statement is about problem that we are trying to answer. In data analysis, it is crucial to have a question about what will be found out.

-   **Data Collection**. Data collection is a process to collect the data, either it is through API or direct downloading the data from the source.

-   **Data Description**. A short description about the field of the data. This will give short but powerful understanding about the data field.

-   **Data Exploration**. The technique to generate data exploration in this section is by answering some business question, and then display the data to answer them. The question asked should support the main problem statement.

-   **Conclusion**. Conclusion is important part of the data analysis. It is strongly recommended to have conclusion in each analysis.
